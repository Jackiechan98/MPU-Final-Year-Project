# MPU-Final-Year-Project
All-in-one Web Portal for Macao-wide IT Competition

The annual Alice3D competition is being held in progress. MPU always asks participants to submit their competition application forms in person at school, which not only increases the workload of participants but also makes the reviewers unable to efficiently check and approve those forms due to the negligence of participants. Reviewers also need to deal with a large number of competitive materials, all of the typos and unsuitable materials will take the reviewer a lot of time and cause various problems in the ceremony. This project was created to solve these problems.
These are the high point of this project. First of all, the participants can not only obtain the information they need for the competition but also access the online submission form for the competition. Secondly, the functions of pattern recognition and information extraction on the uploaded student ID card and paper will facilitate the registration process. Besides, competition materials can then be uploaded to the portal later through a dedicated interface with sophisticated checks. Last but not least, various statistical reports can be generated for pre-defined purposes.

The “front-end-separation” method is used in this project. For the front-end, a framework called ‘uni-app’ has been used, which is for developing front-end applications by using ‘Vue.js’ for developers to develop their user interfaces and receive data from databases. The reason why ‘uni-app’ was been chosen as part of the front end is that developers can write a set of code that can be distributed to multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, H5, and various small programs (WeChat / Alipay / Baidu / headline /QQ/ nail), then it can help developers implement a mobile application for mobile users.

As for the back-end, the framework Flask has been used, which is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to get started quickly and easily for the developers, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It begins as a simple wrapper around ‘Werkzeug’ and ‘Jinja’ and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.
The choice of database is MySQL, which is a fully-managed database service to deploy cloud-native applications, for more concise and efficient development.
Finally, the whole system architecture can be expressed as this figure:
